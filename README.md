## Why ?

- Certain concepts can be described much more  `succinctly, briefly, short ` using generators.

- Instead of creating a function which returns a list of values, one
can write a generator which generates the values on the fly.
This means that  `no list needs to be constructed `, meaning that the
resulting code is more memory efficient. In this way one can even
describe data streams which would simply be too large to fit in memory.

- Generators allow for a natural way to describe  `infinite streams `.
Consider for example the Fibonacci numbers




## TASK 1:
write divisors of optional number
```sh
def divisor(n):
    ...
```

## TASK 2:
count Fibonacci n-th number
```sh
def fib(n):
    ...
fib(16) == 987
fib(34) ==
fib (38) ==

```

## TASK 3:
create array of divisors
```sh
def divisor(n):

```
